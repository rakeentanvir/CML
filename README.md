  <summary><h2>Week 1 Introduction, Motivation, and Linear Regression</h2></summary>

This week sets the stage for the course and introduces how and *why* Machine Learning (ML) can be integrated into causal inference. 

### Roadmap
- Motivate the integration of statistical prediction with causal inference by the emergence of high-dimensional data and flexible, non-linear modelling of the covariates.
- Review statistical properties of Conditional Expectation Function (CEF) and Linear Regression in *low-dimensional space*.
    + Basic matrix-based expression of linear regression is reviewed
- Introduce the *Frisch–Waugh–Lovell Theorem* (FWL) in linear regression as a *partialling out* technique.
- Review basic asymptotic OLS inference and identify issues in standard error estimation in *high-dimensional space*.
- Summarize the concept of *Neyman Orthogonality* as an extension of the FWL Theorem to motivate *Double Machine Learning* (DML) in *high-dimensional space*.

### Materials
- [Slides: Week 1 Introduction](./Week%201%20Motivation%20and%20Linear%20Regression/Week%201%20Slides.pdf)  
- [Supplements: Asymptotic OLS Inference](./Week%201%20Motivation%20and%20Linear%20Regression/Week%201%20Supplements.pdf)

> **Optional Reading:** For students who wish to dive deeper in the asympototic properties of OLS, see the *Week 1 Supplements* on asymptotic inference.
