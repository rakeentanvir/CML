# SOCIOL 690S: Machine Learning in Causal Inference
** Taught by Wenhao Jiang · Department of Sociology · Duke University · Fall 2025*

---

## Week 1 · Introduction, Motivation, and Linear Regression

This week sets the stage for the course and introduces how *Machine Learning (ML)* can be integrated into *Causal Inference*.

### Learning Goals
- Understand the motivation for integrating ML into causal inference.
- Recognize the role of *high-dimensional data* and potential *non-linear relations* as drivers of this integration.
- Review statistical properties of *Linear Regression*.
- Apply the *Frisch–Waugh–Lovell Theorem (FWL)*.
- Summarize the concept of *Neyman Orthogonality* as an extension of FWL Theorem.

### Materials
- [Slides: Week 1 Introduction]("Week 1 Motivation and Linear Regression/Week 1 Slides.pdf")
- [Supplements: Asymptotic OLS Inference]("Week 1 Motivation and Linear Regression/Week 1 Supplements.pdf")

> **Optional Reading:** For students who wish to dive deeper, see the *Week 1 Supplements* on asymptotic OLS inference.
