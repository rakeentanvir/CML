## Week 1 · Introduction, Motivation, and Linear Regression

This week sets the stage for the course and introduces how *Machine Learning (ML)* can be integrated into *Causal Inference*.

### Learning Goals
- Understand the motivation for integrating ML into causal inference.
- Recognize the role of *high-dimensional data* and potential *non-linear relations* as drivers of this integration.
- Review statistical properties of *Linear Regression*.
- Apply the *Frisch–Waugh–Lovell Theorem (FWL)* in linear regression.
- Summarize the concept of *Neyman Orthogonality* as an extension of the FWL Theorem.

### Materials
- [Slides: Week 1 Introduction](./Week%201%20Motivation%20and%20Linear%20Regression/Week%201%20Slides.pdf)  
- [Supplements: Asymptotic OLS Inference](./Week%201%20Motivation%20and%20Linear%20Regression/Week%201%20Supplements.pdf)

> **Optional Reading:** For students who wish to dive deeper, see the *Week 1 Supplements* on asymptotic OLS inference.
